^ Reactor Core mockup ^
## Description:
This is a reactor core which generates a limitless amount of power by extracting the energy from the shield.

# Section 1 - Before the startup.
## Part 1 - The energy
#### What:
The reactor’s fuel source is other energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, fossil fuels, and others. The fuel doesn’t actually power it but it uses the energy generated from it to power the reactor.
#### Why:
The reactor needs energy to start the initial fusion process before it’s self-sustaining.
#### Where:
The sources will be many of the common other energy sources which is of the following:
#### How:
The sources will generate energy which will be stored in a battery before being delivered straight to the plasma generator, which will use the
