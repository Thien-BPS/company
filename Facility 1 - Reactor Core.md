This is a document for the plasma reactor core design and construction.

^ Reactor Core mockup ^

## Description:

This is a reactor core which generates a limitless amount of power by extracting the energy from the shield.

# Section 1 - Before the startup.
## Part 1 - The energy
#### What:

The reactor’s fuel source is other energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, fossil fuels, and others. The fuel doesn’t actually power it but it uses the energy generated from it to power the reactor.

#### Who:

This project in reality is only made by me.
If this does become mainstream, this will be designed and constructed by ~30,000 people.

#### When:

This project will be finished by (probably) 2027.

#### Where:

The sources will be many of the common other energy sources which is of the following:
1. Fossil Fuels
1. Hydro Dams
1. Wind Turbines
1. Solar Power
1. Nuclear Power

and more.

#### Why:

The reactor needs energy to start the initial fusion process before it’s self-sustaining.

#### How:
The sources will generate energy which will be stored in a battery before being delivered straight to the plasma generator, which will use the energy to fuse hydrogen atoms together and generate lots of energy in the process.

## Part 2 - The lasers

#### Main Lasers
>This is the two primary lasers required to start and sustain the reactor.
>The main lasers is required because these are the power beams, used to sustain and actually start the reactor.
>If these are not available, the reactor would not start.  
>How:
>>The main fuel & hydrogen source is delivered from here which is one of the primary reasons why this is nesscary.
>>It also heats the reactor enough to continue and regulate the nuclear fusion.

#### Power Lasers
>These are the lasers to determine if the reaction should be fast and hot or slow and cold. These are also adjustable.
>While you don't technically need the power lasers, the reactor won't be sustainable this way.
>The fuel & hydrogen source is also delivered here.

#### Stablization Lasers
>These are the most important lasers because these regulate and stablize (hence the name) the fusion inside the core.
>If there's a defect in these, this will cause the reactor to destablize and cause a thermal runaway and explode the entire facility.
>How this works is that it shoots lasers at the shield to power it. While it's doing that, it pulls out the extra helium and splits it back into hydrogen which is delivered back to the reactor via the main lasers.
