This is a document for the plasma reactor core design and construction.

^ Reactor Core mockup ^

## Description:

This is a reactor core which generates a limitless amount of power by extracting the energy from the shield.

# Section 1 - Before the startup.
## Part 1 - The energy
#### What:

The reactor’s fuel source is other energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, fossil fuels, and others. The fuel doesn’t actually power it but it uses the energy generated from it to power the reactor.

#### Who:

This project in reality is only made by me.
If this does become mainstream, this will be designed and constructed by ~30,000 people.

#### When:

This project will be finished by (probably) 2027.

#### Where:

The sources will be many of the common other energy sources which is of the following:
1. Fossil Fuels
1. Hydro Dams
1. Wind Turbines
1. Solar Power
1. Nuclear Power

and more.

#### Why:

The reactor needs energy to start the initial fusion process before it’s self-sustaining.

#### How:
The sources will generate energy which will be stored in a battery before being delivered straight to the plasma generator, which will use the energy to fuse hydrogen atoms together and generate lots of energy in the process.
